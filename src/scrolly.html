                    When Columbia students arrive on campus, they enter a neighborhood, like all New York City
                    neighborhoods, with its own civic and political landscape. In West Harlem, that landscape has been
                    the focal point of debates over the University’s expanding landownership, restricted campus access,
                    and impact on surrounding neighborhoods.

                <p>
                    Columbia sits in West Harlem, the neighborhood that makes up Manhattan’s Community District 9, which
                    stretches from 110th Street to 155th Street and runs from the Hudson River on the west to Manhattan
                    Avenue and Edgecombe Avenue on the east.

                <p>
                    District 9 is represented by Community Board 9, one of 59 advisory boards across the city. While the
                    boards do not pass laws, they make recommendations on land use, zoning, liquor licenses, and city
                    budget priorities. CB9 board members are appointed by Manhattan Borough President Mark Levine, with
                    at least half nominated by New York City Council members. Members serve as unpaid city officials,
                    and the board is currently chaired by Victor Edwards.

                    CB9 is divided into 10 standing committees that meet monthly, in addition to ad-hoc committees.
                    These include arts and culture, the cannabis task force, economic development, health and
                    environment, housing, land use and zoning, landmarks preservation and parks, senior action, the
                    SGL/LGBTQ task force, strategic planning, uniformed services and transportation, and youth,
                    education, and libraries. New York City residents can attend committee meetings, testify during
                    hearings, and provide input on city services and local development projects.

                    The neighborhood is represented in the City Council by District 7 City Council member Shaun Abreu,
                    CC ’14. District 7 spans the north of Manhattan, from the Upper West Side through Morningside
                    Heights, West Harlem, Manhattan Valley, Manhattanville, Hamilton Heights, and Washington Heights.
                    Abreu won the Democratic nomination for his seat during the citywide primary election in June. He
                    won two previous City Council races in 2021 and 2023.

                    Morningside Gardens, and two major parks. Due to its concentration of globally renowned institutions
                    and architecture, Morningside Heights has been dubbed the “acropolis of the new world.”

                    Just north of Morningside Heights is Manhattanville, which has become central to the University’s
                    expansion. Once a Dutch settlement and later a Revolutionary War site, it is now the location of
                    Columbia’s new Manhattanville campus.

                    The University first announced its plans to redevelop 17 acres of the neighborhood into a new campus
                    in 2003, under then-University President Lee Bollinger. According to Columbia’s master plan for the
                    development, the Manhattanville expansion is meant to provide “innovative academic space” to keep
                    the University at the forefront of global research, foster cross-disciplinary collaboration, and
                    create an open, sustainable campus that strengthens ties with the surrounding community.

                    Construction began in 2008 after New York state approved Columbia’s eminent domain pursuits—despite
                    objections from activists, residents, and business owners concerned about displacement,
                    gentrification, and the loss of neighborhood character. The first buildings opened up in 2017,

                    Manhattanville is also home to the City College of New York. For many residents, Columbia’s growth
                    here symbolizes the broader tension between economic development and the risk of displacement.
                    Recently state legislators reintroduced a bill to revoke the University’s authorization for the
                    Manhattanville expansion amid longstanding concerns that its commitment to affordable housing and
                    community benefits have fallen short.

                    A 2024 analysis by the Community Service Society found that in the ten years following the state’s
                    eminent domain approvals, the neighborhood’s Black population decreased by 14 percent, its Hispanic
                    population decreased by 10 percent, and the area saw a loss of nearly 6,000 rent-regulated units
                    between 2010 and 2020.

                    Hamilton Heights has been the site of recent disputes over supportive housing—housing communities
                    built by the city to support individuals transitioning out of drug abuse, homelessness, or other
                    difficult situations. Some community members argue that the neighborhood has taken on more than its
                    share of such facilities, in comparison to other parts of the city. The conflict arose after the
                    city began development on another supportive housing building in the area without CB9 approval.

                <p>
                    These shifting neighborhood dynamics in Upper Manhattan are tied to Columbia’s position as the
                    city’s largest private landowner. Because the University is an educational nonprofit, it is largely
                    exempt from property taxes, a benefit valued at about $170 million per year.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="step" id="step-14">
                <p>
                    To address community concerns over its continued land expansion but lack of community investment due
                    to tax exemption, Columbia signed the Community Benefits Agreement in 2009, promising $170 million
                    in investments over 36 years. That commitment, coordinated and distributed through an independent
                    nonprofit, the West Harlem Development Corporation, amounts to roughly $4.7 million annually.

                    The pledged community benefits includes 5,000 square feet of arts space for use by local residents,
                    $76 million in a benefits fund, $20 million for affordable housing, and $20 million in in-kind
                    benefits, or access to campus service. Sixteen years later, some community leaders and artists say
                    that many of these commitments have yet to be fully realized. Spectator has previously spoken to
                    artists and community leaders who described limited access to affordable studio and exhibition
                    space, noting that only $400,000 of the $20 million allocated for campus use had been spent amid
                    delays and restrictions.

                    that provide local jobs and economic opportunity, along with sustainable community partnerships

                    Residents in the area have previously criticized Columbia’s role in decreasing affordability and
                    changing the neighborhood’s demographics: Due to the University’s status as a nonprofit landowning
                    institution, it has the ability to convert rent-stabilized units into affiliate housing once the
                    primary tenant dies, rather than putting the unit back onto the market in its rent-stabilized
                    status. As a result, the local community consistently faces displacement and rising prices.

                    As the landowner of the Red Balloon Learning Center, a University-affiliated daycare school serving
                    West Harlem and Morningside Heights, Columbia informed the school community in 2022 that it would
                    not be renewing the center’s lease. Out of the six Columbia-affiliated centers that offered over
                    nine hours for five days a week for daycare, Red Balloon charged the second-lowest monthly tuition
                    rate for toddlers. Parents and staff described the decision as devastating, worrying that it would
                    eliminate a rare community-centered child care option for both Columbia affiliates and local

                    it would provide information and resources to all families seeking a new program, regardless of
                    their affiliation with Columbia, but did not specify a reason for ending Red Balloon’s lease.

                    In October 2023, the University closed its gates to anyone without a Columbia ID, thereby cutting
                    off community members from College Walk, the essential pedestrian path that connects Broadway to
                    Amsterdam Avenue. The University initially restricted campus access ahead of planned demonstrations
                    over the war in Gaza. Campus access has remained limited ever since, sparking a debate—and a
                    lawsuit—over private versus public space and Columbia’s role in the neighborhood.

                    While Columbia officials said the closures were for safety reasons, residents and elected leaders
                    objected, citing the impact on seniors and people with disabilities. In January a group of local
                    residents filed a class action lawsuit against the University, claiming the closures violated both
                    the Americans with Disabilities Act and a decades-old easement agreement. That agreement, written in
                    1953 when the city gave Columbia control of the section of 116th Street that is now College Walk,
                    required that the block remain open to the public as a pedestrian walkway.

                    CB9 has taken an active role in responding to these conflicts. In February it voted against renewing
                    Columbia’s liquor license for Lerner Hall, framing the decision as a response to the continued gate
                    closures. CB9 Chair Victor Edwards, alongside City Council member Shaun Abreu, called on Columbia to
                    reopen its gates in an op-ed published in the New York Daily News on Jan. 15.

                    “This closure is more than an inconvenience; it is a breach of trust and a violation of the
                    agreements that govern this historic pathway,” they wrote.
